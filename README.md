# htdocsXporter

Simple program to copy xampp htdocs folder to other folder or in my case, to a USB.

I've wrote this because i'm using Xampp in class and when I leave I want to copy all the files without going to the folder and copying. So this makes it automatically.

# How to use
You execute it and then write the folder inside htdocs/ that you want to copy
