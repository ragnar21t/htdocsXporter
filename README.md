# htdocsXporter

Simple program to copy xampp htdocs folder to other folder or in my case, to a USB.

I've wrote this because i'm using Xampp in class and when I leave I want to copy all the files without going to the folder and copying. So this makes it automatically.

# How to use
Download the executable, when you execute it you have to write the folder name you want to copy.

# Build it yourself
You can build it yourself too.

Download the source code and install pyinstaller. 

Then execute this:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --icon=icon.ico main.py
```
